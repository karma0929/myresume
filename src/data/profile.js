      summary:
        'I am a Computer Science graduate student passionate about building real-world AI systems that bridge research and practical applications. My interests lie in machine learning, computer vision, and large language models, with a focus on deploying AI solutions in real-world scenarios. I have hands-on experience in developing AI-driven systems. My work includes building a multi-agent LLM-based system for Verilog code generation and hardware optimization, integrating OpenROAD to evaluate PPA (power, performance, area) metrics, and designing feedback-driven optimization pipelines. I have also developed facial motion recognition systems on Huawei Ascend edge devices and built generative AI pipelines using Stable Diffusion and LoRA for game asset creation. I am particularly interested in applied AI, multimodal systems, and intelligent automation, and I enjoy working on projects that combine multiple modalities such as vision, language, and interaction. I am currently seeking Summer 2026 internship opportunities in AI, machine learning, or software engineering, where I can contribute to impactful systems and continue growing as an engineer.',
